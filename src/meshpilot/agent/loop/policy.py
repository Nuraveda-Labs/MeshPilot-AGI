"""Action policy gate (AGENT-POLICY) — a deterministic allow/deny check on every tool call.

OpenClaw-style: the loop is untrusted (an LLM picks tools); this gate is trusted and runs
BEFORE any tool executes. Rules, in order:

1. **Per-brand deny** — a brand may forbid specific tools outright.
2. **External MCP default-deny** — an `mcp__*` tool is allowed only if per-brand allowlisted, has a
   read-only verb prefix, or publishing is on; everything else is denied (leaky-denylist fix, #93).
3. **Publish kill-switch** — every publish/post tool is denied unless publishing is explicitly
   enabled (config `agent_publish_enabled`, default False). Posting stays off until flipped.
4. **Per-run cost budget** — expensive paid media generation is capped per loop run so a
   runaway agent can't rack up spend.

The `Policy` is a pure value object (no I/O) so it unit-tests trivially; `from_config()` builds
one from settings, and `allow()` is a thin back-compat wrapper over the default policy.

# outward, irreversible act in the operator's name, and one switch for it is not enough.

# External MCP tools default-DENY (#93): we can't know an arbitrary MCP tool's blast radius, so a
# tool is allowed only if it is explicitly allowlisted per brand, has a read-only verb prefix, or
# publishing is deliberately enabled. A denylist of "bad" verbs is leaky (misses create/update/run/
# grant/…) — an allowlist is the safe default.

# 🔴 Some MCP servers expose ONE tool per app and hide the verb in an argument. viaSocket does this:
# `mcp__viasocket__Gmail` takes an `action_name`, and the same tool can Search Email Messages OR Send
# Email. Gating on the tool NAME cannot tell those apart — measured 2026-09-17, where that single
# tool was reachable with send/reply/draft/label actions among its options.
#
# So a call carrying one of these keys is treated as UNCLASSIFIABLE by name: the read-only prefix
# check does not apply to it, and `publish_enabled` does NOT wave it through — publishing being on
# means the agent may post content, never that it may send mail as the operator. The ONLY way
# through is an explicit `<PREFIX>_MCP_ALLOW` entry naming the exact action: "tool:action".
