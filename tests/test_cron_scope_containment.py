"""Issue #195: the self-scheduling scope clamp only covered `agentTurn`.

A `chat`-scoped run could self-schedule a `capability` or `pipelineTurn` job that fires later with
powers the creating run never held — widening the agent's own powers across time, which is exactly
what the clamp exists to prevent.

# `service._run_pipeline_turn` deliberately RE-RESOLVES the pipeline from the registry at FIRE time
# (so kill-switches are read live) — and a pipeline's scope is not static: `content` resolves to
# `content_draft` while `agent_content_media_enabled` is off, and to `content` (which grants media
# tools) once it's on. A run narrowly scoped at create time could pre-arm a `content` pipelineTurn
# that passed containment then, and have it fire later — after an operator flips the switch — with
# media tools its creator never held. `_run_pipeline_turn` must re-check containment at fire time
# against the scope stamped on the job when it was created (`created_scope`).
