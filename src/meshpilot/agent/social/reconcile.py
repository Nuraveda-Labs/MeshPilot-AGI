"""Reconcile asynchronous social publishes to a terminal state — SOCIAL outbox sweep.

Buffer accepts a post and returns "sending", not delivery; `publish.publish_one` records that
honestly as `social_post.status='pending'`, but nothing moved those rows forward, so every Buffer
submission stayed `pending` forever and `derive_status` could never settle a campaign.

Same idea as the scheduler's `_reconcile_awaiting_webhook` (which handles `ScheduledPost` rows, not
`social_post`), applied to the social outbox, sharing the vendor poll
`platforms.buffer.poll_status_for_post`.

Meta platforms (facebook/instagram) return a real post id synchronously and are already terminal at
publish time, so they never appear in this sweep.
