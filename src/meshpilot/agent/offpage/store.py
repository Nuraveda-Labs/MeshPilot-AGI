"""OFF-PAGE store — the spine's rows, and nothing lever-specific.

`offpage_candidate` is what we could say and where; `offpage_outcome` is what happened after we
said it. Every lever (syndicate, reply, haro) writes the same rows, which is what gives the operator
one approval UX and one digest. Design: docs/plans/2026-09-12-offpage-seo.md § 3.
