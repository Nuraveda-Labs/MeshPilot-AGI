"""Per-brand narrative positioning — the ground truth the content pipeline writes FROM.

Separate from `agent_memory` facts (atomic "what is true" — pricing, features, brokers) because
voice, the never-say list, and positioning rationale are judgements, not facts. Without this, the
agent once generated prop-firm payout content for a brand that is not a prop firm — every individual
claim was plausible, but off-brand. Facts stop the agent being wrong; this stops it being off-brand.
Read by the ideator, the caption writer, and the conscience critic.

Stored in the DB, not on disk: the repo is open-core, so brand-specific content must never be
committed, and gitignored files under `brand/prompts/` don't survive a deploy.
