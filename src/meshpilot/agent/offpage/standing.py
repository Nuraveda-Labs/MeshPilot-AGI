"""OFFPAGE-2 STANDING — the reply ladder's stage, derived from evidence, never set.

    R0  the operator posts by hand                         (always available)
    R1  the agent posts after a 2h veto window   entry: comment_karma ≥ 100 AND age ≥ 180 d
                                                        AND approvals+operator posts (30 d) ≥ 20
                                                        AND rejections (30 d) ≤ 2
    R2  no veto window                          entry: R1 AND 30 consecutive agent posts with no
                                                        rejection and no moderator removal

A removal (a `removed` status, written when a posted comment is gone 24h later) drops the stage
to R0 — it is the most recent event, so any history that starts with it fails R2, and the
30-day rejection count carries it into R1's gate. Mirrors `seo.track.standing`.
