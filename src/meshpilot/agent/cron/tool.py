"""The `schedule` loop capability-tool — how the agent schedules its OWN future work.

Self-scoped: an agent-owned job is stamped `owner = agent:<brand>`, and `list`/`cancel` only ever
see or touch jobs with that owner, so one brand's agent can never read or cancel another's (or the
operator's) jobs. `create` respects the global kill-switch and a per-brand creator-cap. `next_check`
re-paces the job currently executing (from the run context), clamped to its pacing bounds.
