"""An empty completion is a failure, not an answer (ROUTER).

The defect this pins: a reasoning model given a budget sized for the ANSWER spends it all on
thinking and returns `content: null` / `finish_reason: "length"`. That was translated into `""` and
handed back as a successful result, so every caller on the affected tier silently received an empty
string and carried on — which is how an entire model tier stayed broken unnoticed.
