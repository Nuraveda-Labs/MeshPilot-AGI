"""Curator (AGENT-LEARN) — the agent's self-improvement step, Hermes-style.

After the loop runs, episodes ("what I did") accumulate in memory. The curator periodically
distills recent, not-yet-curated episodes into a few **durable lessons** — generalized,
reusable facts stored as `kind='fact'` (upserted by a stable `lesson:<slug>` key, so re-running
updates rather than duplicates). Those facts are surfaced by the loop's seed-recall on future
runs, so the agent gets better over time. Processed episodes are marked `curated` in metadata so
they aren't distilled again and recall favors the distilled lessons.

Pure orchestration with every dependency injectable (llm, remember_fn, fetch_fn, mark_fn) so it
unit-tests without network or DB. `curate()` uses the real Claude LLM + Postgres by default.
