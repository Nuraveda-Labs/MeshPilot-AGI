"""SURFACES (TARGET-2) — deciding *where* to speak, from evidence rather than assumption.

The content matrix answers "what format next". Nothing answered "in which room", so the agent
broadcast to a fixed platform list. This ranks the rooms sensing has found.

**The scoring claim, stated plainly so it can be argued with:**

    fit = relevance_density × (0.5 + 0.5 × reach_norm)

Relevance dominates and reach only modulates it. That is deliberate, and it is the whole opinion of
this module: **a small room full of your audience beats a large room that merely contains them.**
Concretely — r/Forex has 547,438 subscribers and r/PropFirmTester 28,258, roughly 19x. If the brand's
queries keep surfacing threads in the smaller room, it should win, because reach you cannot address
is not reach. A purely reach-ranked list would send every brand to the biggest generic room, which is
exactly the broadcast behaviour this replaces.

`reach_norm` is logarithmic: the difference between 1k and 10k subscribers matters far more than
between 500k and 5M, because participation is bounded by attention in a thread, not by the room's
total size.

**What this module refuses to do.** Until measured engagement exists for a surface, its score is
marked `provisional` — a prior, not a finding. This mirrors `MIN_SAMPLES_TO_RANK` in the matrix and
the curator that declines to conclude below threshold. The agent has never posted to Reddit, so at
the time of writing *every* surface is provisional, and callers must present them as candidates
rather than as evidence.

Nothing here names a subreddit, platform or industry.
