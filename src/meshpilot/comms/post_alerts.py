"""Post alerts: every successful publish, on any platform, is announced in the brand's Discord
`#posts-<brand>` channel (operator request 2026-09-25: "alerts whenever the agent posts anything
for any brand").

Called from the four platform publishers themselves — `publish_instagram`, `publish_facebook`,
`buffer.create_post` and `youtube.upload_video` — rather than from each pipeline, because those are
the one choke point every path goes through (CLIPNET, Drive-to-social, campaigns, syndication,
manual test posts). A pipeline added later is covered without knowing this module exists.

Channel: `<PREFIX>_POSTS_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID`. Token: the agent's own DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN.
Best effort, bounded: a missing channel is a silent no-op, and a slow or failing Discord call is
cut off after ALERT_TIMEOUT_S and logged — an alert can never delay or fail the post it describes.
