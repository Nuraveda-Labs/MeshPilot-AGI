"""Cross-worker shared state backed by Postgres (#98).

FastAPI Cloud runs multiple workers, so an in-process set/dict can't dedup webhooks or throttle
requests across the fleet. These helpers put that state in Postgres. Both are FAIL-OPEN: a DB error
must never drop a real webhook or turn the rate-limit backstop into an outage.

The engine is injectable so this unit-tests without a real DB.
