"""Reckoning (DELIBERATION Phase 1) — expectation before acting, honest self-assessment after.

Before a run acts it records a one-line EXPECTATION (what it intends to produce + what success looks
like) — a real pre-commitment, not hindsight. After the run it compares that expectation to what
ACTUALLY happened (the action transcript + any tool errors) and produces a short self-assessment with
a fault attribution when it fell short. It is grounded only in the run's own evidence, so it is tagged
`trust="self-assessed"` and is NEVER treated as a verified signal — external grounding (approval,
engagement) is a later phase. Advisory only: it annotates the episode (so LEARN can curate patterns of
self-flagged misses) and is surfaced to the human reviewer; it blocks nothing.

One model call each on the loop model by default (`AGENT_DELIBERATION_MODEL` can point it at a cheaper
model like Haiku once that key's access is confirmed), and every call is wrapped so deliberation can
never fail the run. Gated by `agent_reckoning_enabled` (default off) at the runner.
