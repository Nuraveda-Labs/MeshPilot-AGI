"""Publishing a post into the site repo (SEO-2), at stage S0.

The site is a Vite app on Cloudflare Pages, so publishing is a **code change**: insert a typed post
object into `src/data/blog.ts`, run the site's own verification gates, and open a PR. CF Pages builds
on merge.

**Stage S0 by default: the agent authors and opens a PR; a human merges.** Autonomy is earned, not
configured — the amended AI-SEO program grants S1 (agent merges its own PR) only after five
consecutive posts pass every gate with zero human edits to the body, measured as the diff between
what was proposed and what was merged. `stage` is therefore a parameter with a deliberately
conservative default rather than a flag someone flips early.

**The gates are the site's own**, not ones invented here — `typecheck`, `lint`, `schemas:validate`,
`links:audit`. Running the repo's real commands means the agent is held to the same bar as a human
contributor, and a gate that changes there changes here for free.

Everything that touches git, the shell or the filesystem is injectable, so the logic is testable
without a repo, a network, or an npm install.
