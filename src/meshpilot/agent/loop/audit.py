"""Routing audit (ROUTER self-monitoring) — data-grounded drift + fallback detection.

Reads `usage_events` (the durable per-model cost/volume record — cross-worker, unlike the in-process
routing metrics) and flags real anomalies for a human:

  (a) **primary_idle** (severity: info) — a tier whose PRIMARY model had no calls while a FALLBACK did.
      This is a SOFT signal, not a verdict: `usage_events` records only the served model, not the
      requested tier, so the fallback may have served because the primary was degraded/rate-limited OR
      because a caller pinned it directly (e.g. a content env override). Flagged for a human to verify.
  (b) **cost_per_call_drift** — a model whose recent cost-per-call is well above its own baseline.

No ML, no "auto-tuning" of thresholds — just anomalies grounded in actual usage. Run nightly via the
`routing_audit` cron capability, or on demand via GET /internal/agent/routing/audit.
