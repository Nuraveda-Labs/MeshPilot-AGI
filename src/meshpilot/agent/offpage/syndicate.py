"""OFFPAGE-1 SYNDICATE — every merged blog post earns its two days on the brand's own feeds.

The blog ladder produces a post; nothing told anyone. This lever takes each merged
`seo_publication` and writes one short post per platform, from the live page itself, then hands it
to the Buffer publisher: X on day 0, LinkedIn the next day. One syndication per post per platform,
ever — the unique index on `offpage_candidate` is the promise, not the code.

What makes this safe to run unattended:
- The **page is the fact source.** Every figure in the draft must appear on the page it links to;
  the page already passed the blog's own gates, so nothing new can be invented here.
- The brand's hard-stop phrases refuse the draft (not scrub it — a 240-char post with a sentence
  cut out is not a post).
- One action per platform per run, so the backfill of already-merged posts trickles out at the
  daily cadence instead of dumping seven tweets in a minute.
- A draft that fails its checks leaves **no row** — nothing external happened, so tomorrow retries.
  A publish that fails leaves a `skipped` row with the error, because the external side effect is
  unknown and a human must look before it is tried again.

Design: docs/plans/2026-09-12-offpage-seo.md § 4 S1. Nothing here names a brand or a site.
