"""Brief → ROUTE → AUTHOR: the self-driving front of the creative pipeline.

Adapted from the monorepo's `media/content_router.py`. The shape that matters, and the thing the
previous pipeline lacked entirely:

  1. ROUTE, deterministically, on what the post IS. A comparison of two rules wants a structured
     card; a conceptual idea wants a generated still; a demonstration wants motion. Nothing here is
     hardcoded to one renderer — `asset_kind` comes from the agent when it decides what to post, so
     "today I should contrast our 50M rule against another firm's" routes itself.
  2. AUTHOR the spec that renderer needs, refining a LOOSE brief into a model-ready one. This is the
     step whose absence made the last campaign generic: it sent `f"{angle}: {hook}"` straight to a
     photorealism model. One LLM step shapes structure and copy; the technique functions and the
     card renderer stay deterministic.
  3. GUARD. Prohibited phrases fail the draft closed, before any paid generation.

Brand voice, palette and prohibitions are read from the brand's own positioning row — never
hardcoded here — so a second brand gets its own art direction with no code change.
