"""Conscience (DELIBERATION Phase 2) — an INDEPENDENT critic checks a run's outward-intended output
against a written constitution (`agent/CONSCIENCE.md`) before it reaches a human.

Not self-grading: this is a separate model call with a FRESH context — it never sees the actor's
transcript or reasoning, only the proposed output and the constitution — so the author can't
rationalize its own work past the check (self-critique by the same context is gameable). Advisory for
now: the verdict annotates the episode and is surfaced to the human reviewing the draft; it blocks
nothing, because publishing is drafts-only. When outward actions (publish/spend/reply) are enabled
later, the same critic becomes a pre-commit HARD gate on those specific tools.

One model call on the loop model (or AGENT_DELIBERATION_MODEL), wrapped so it can never fail the run. Gated by `agent_conscience_enabled`
(default off) at the runner.
