"""Shared run store for the backgrounded agent-loop endpoint (AGENT-LOOP).

The run endpoint returns a `run_id` immediately and executes the loop under
`asyncio.create_task`. FastAPI Cloud runs multiple workers, so run state must live somewhere
every worker can read — an in-process dict is not pollable (POST and GET can hit different
workers). This persists run state to Postgres (`agent_runs`) and reads it back by id.

The SQLAlchemy `engine` is injectable so this unit-tests without a real DB.
