"""Guard against asyncpg's AmbiguousParameterError, which unit tests structurally cannot catch.

A bind parameter used only in a bare `:p IS NULL` gives asyncpg nothing to infer its type from, so
it raises `could not determine data type of parameter $N` and the whole statement never runs. This
shipped: `mark_result`'s `submitted_at` CASE failed on EVERY publish, posts went out to Facebook and
nothing was recorded, and no test noticed — the FakeEngine used throughout the suite does not
type-check parameters, so it happily returned success.

A behavioural test cannot cover this without a live Postgres, so this is a static one: any bind
parameter compared against NULL must be CAST. Cheap, and it generalises to every statement we write.
