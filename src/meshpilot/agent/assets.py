"""Brand asset library — the real image files the creative pipeline composites in.

An image model asked for a third-party mark (FTMO, MT5) produces a mangled, trademark-misrepresenting
approximation — so logos are never generated, only stored files placed by code.

Assets are scoped to an OWNER brand (the tenant), while `slug`/`name` identify the DEPICTED brand,
usually a third party we integrate with.
