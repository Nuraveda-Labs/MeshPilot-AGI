"""Prop-firm rule knowledge base — the only source of firm thresholds the agent may publish.

A firm rule is a precise, dated claim about a third party's product. Left unconstrained, the model
invents plausible numbers the conscience critic won't catch — its prohibitions cover our own
invented figures, not a competitor's threshold stated as fact. So rules come from this table or not
at all.

The `publishable` flag matters more than the numbers: the upstream engine table this is seeded from
also holds backtesting values that are wrong as public claims (synthetic gates, sentinel zeros for
"no such rule", rules for firms no longer selling) — each would read as a fluent, false sentence.
