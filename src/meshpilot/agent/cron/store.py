"""Durable job + run store for AGENT-CRON.

`claim_due` is the concurrency core: it selects due jobs `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, advances each
job's `next_run_at` (or spends a one-shot) and inserts a `scheduled_runs` row — all in one
transaction, so across N workers each due job is claimed exactly once. The lock is released on
commit, before the (potentially long) payload runs. Everything else is ordinary CRUD.

The SQLAlchemy engine is injectable so the CRUD/finish logic unit-tests without a real DB; the
SKIP-LOCKED exactly-once guarantee is a Postgres property, asserted in the live check.
