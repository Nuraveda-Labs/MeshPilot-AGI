"""Per-brand agent memory store (AGENT-MEM).

`remember` embeds content (passage) and upserts a fact (by key) or appends an episode.
`recall` embeds the query (query) and returns top-k memories by a fused score:
    score = w_sem * cosine_similarity + w_lex * ts_rank
tie-broken by importance then recency; the winners' `last_used_at` is bumped.

Embedding failures never block a write (row stored with NULL embedding, still lexically
searchable) or a read (falls back to lexical-only). Both the SQLAlchemy `engine` and the
`embed_fn` are injectable so this unit-tests without a DB or network.
