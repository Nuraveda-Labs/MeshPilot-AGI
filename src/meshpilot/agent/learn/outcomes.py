"""Revise strategy from MEASURED outcomes — the step that closes the loop.

`curator.py` distils the agent's own record of what it did, producing lessons about intentions only.
This curator reads `social_post_metric` joined to each campaign's `choices`, so its lessons are about
what actually happened.

Below the ranking threshold this writes nothing and says so, rather than hedging — a durable lesson
shapes every future post and looks identical to a founded one once written, so an unfounded one
compounds rather than decaying.

Lessons are `kind='fact'` with a stable `perf:` key (re-running updates, not duplicates) and
`source='curator'`, which deliberately does not satisfy the operator-verified gate — a self-derived
lesson can never be quoted as ground truth by the conscience critic, only surfaced as an
unverified note.
