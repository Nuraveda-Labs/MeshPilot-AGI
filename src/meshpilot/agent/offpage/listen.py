"""OFFPAGE-2 LISTEN (Reddit) — perceive before speaking; read-only, ~$0.002 a read.

For each of the brand's declared `offpage.audience_queries`, search Reddit (relevance sort — the
only sort that targets, measured 2026-09-02), remember every thread in `signal_item`, and remember
every community the query surfaced in `surface` so scoring and the rules sync have something to
work on. Then rescore surfaces and fetch rules for rooms that have none (Zernio, idempotent).

Nothing here decides anything. Design: docs/plans/2026-09-12-offpage-seo.md § 4 S2.
