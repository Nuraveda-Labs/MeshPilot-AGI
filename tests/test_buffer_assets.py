"""Buffer's CreatePostInput.assets shape — confirmed by introspecting the live schema.

Every image post to X, LinkedIn and TikTok failed with `Variable "$input" got invalid value
{ photos: [{ url: ... }] }`. The payload was a DICT; the schema declares:

    assets: [AssetInput!]!            -- a REQUIRED, NON-NULL LIST
    AssetInput { image | video | document }
    ImageAssetInput { url! , thumbnailUrl, metadata }

Two errors in one line: the wrong container (dict vs list) and the wrong keys (photos/videos vs
image/video). Guessing was never going to land it, which is why this stayed broken until the API key
was available to introspect with.
