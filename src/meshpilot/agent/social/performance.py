"""Aggregate measured outcomes per matrix cell — the evidence the curator is allowed to reason from.

Joins `social_post_metric` (measured outcomes) against `social_campaign.choices` (what the agent
decided) to produce per-(asset_kind, pillar, platform) means.

- Comparisons use a single age bucket (24h default) — comparing a 7d read against a 1h read measures
  how long each post had been up, not the content.
- Meta exposes no impressions/reach for these Page posts, so engagement is an absolute count,
  confounded by posting time and follower growth — hence the ranking threshold below.
- Platform is part of the cell key: Facebook and Instagram have different audiences and engagement
  scales, so pooling them would let platform mix decide the winner instead of the content choice.
