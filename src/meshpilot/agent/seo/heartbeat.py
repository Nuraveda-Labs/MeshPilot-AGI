"""Alerting on the GAP between SEO cycles (SEO-9).

`seo_cycle` made a failure queryable. Nobody queries it. This is what turns "you could have noticed"
into "you were told".

**The thing being watched is silence, not an error.** A cycle that crashes logs a row with
`ok=False`; a cycle that never runs at all — laptop asleep, launchd unloaded, plist broken, the Mac
simply off — logs nothing, and nothing is exactly what a quiet, healthy day looks like. So the signal
is the AGE of the newest row, and no row at all is the loudest case rather than a missing one.

⚠️ **This runs in the CLOUD, not on the Mac.** A watcher living on the machine it watches dies with
it, and reports nothing at precisely the moment there is something to report. It needs only the
database, so the agent's own cron can host it.

⚠️ **It must never write to `seo_cycle`.** Recording its own run there would refresh the newest-row
timestamp and mask the very gap it exists to measure — the watcher would permanently reassure itself.
