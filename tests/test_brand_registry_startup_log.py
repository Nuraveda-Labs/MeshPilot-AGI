"""The brand registry announces itself at startup — ids only, and never on /healthz.

Why this exists
---------------
`_default_brand_config()` is a built-in fallback that serves a brand nobody configured.
That is supportable on a laptop and wrong in production, and until this log line there
was NO way to tell from outside which had happened: a healthy instance looks identical
either way. Deciding whether the fallback could be retired meant guessing.

⚠️ This is deliberately a LOG and not a /healthz field. `/healthz` is unauthenticated
on purpose (tests/test_healthz_scheduler.py pins its exact key set), so brand ids there
would publish a multi-tenant instance's customer list to anyone who asks.

⚠️ These tests read STDOUT and never call logging.basicConfig, on purpose. The first
version of this line used stdlib `logging.info` and was verified with a caplog test
that passed — while emitting NOTHING in production, because nothing in src/meshpilot/
configures logging and uvicorn leaves the root logger at WARNING. The test created the
very condition that made the code look correct. Capturing stdout under the default
configuration is the only assertion that distinguishes "logged" from "logged where
somebody will actually read it".
