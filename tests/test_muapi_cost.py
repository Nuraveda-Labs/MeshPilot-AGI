"""MUapi cost calibration, checked against a real balance delta rather than a guess.

Reconciliation reported 46x "drift": 24 image generations as $0.0097 of true spend. That is four
hundredths of a cent per image, which is not a plausible price for nano-banana or Gemini image
generation — the number was the tell that a UNIT was wrong, not that our estimate was.

MUapi's balance is denominated in DOLLARS. It was being treated as credits at $0.01, dividing real
spend by 100. Once corrected, our estimate was revealed to be HALF the true cost — the dangerous
direction, since the daily cap was permitting about twice the spend it was configured for.
