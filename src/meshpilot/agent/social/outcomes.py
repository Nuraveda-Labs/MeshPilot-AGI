"""Collect what published posts actually achieved — the learning loop's sensor.

Before this, `curator.py` distilled lessons only from the agent's own account of what it did, so a
"durable lesson" could be learned from a post that flopped. Readings are taken at fixed age buckets
(not continuously) because engagement accrues over days — "this post at 24h" vs "that post at 24h" is
the only comparable quantity; readings spaced by sweep timing are not.
