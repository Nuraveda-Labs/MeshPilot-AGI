"""Read back what a published post actually achieved.

The publishing clients are write-only; nothing in the codebase ever asked a platform how a post
performed. This is the read side, and it is deliberately thin: fetch the numbers, normalise the
names, hand back a dict. Interpretation belongs to the learning loop, not here.

Coverage is honest rather than uniform. Meta (Facebook Pages, Instagram) exposes per-post insights
on the same Graph credentials we already publish with, so those are real. Posts routed through
Buffer (X, LinkedIn, TikTok) are NOT covered: Buffer's API returns delivery status and an
`externalLink`, not analytics, so metrics for those would need each platform's own API and its own
app review. Returning nothing for them is correct — a fabricated zero would poison the loop far
worse than a gap, because "no engagement" and "not measured" would become indistinguishable.
