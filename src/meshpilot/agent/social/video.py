"""HeyGen Video Agent client (no avatar) — SOCIAL-4.

Self-contained: this is NOT a media-factory engine/recipe. It talks to HeyGen's Video Agent API
directly (prompt + reference files -> generated clip), persists the result to the brand's own
Supabase Storage bucket via `meshpilot.media.generation.storage.upload_bytes`, and meters the
spend through the same `usage_events` choke point as the avatar engine.

Contract verified against developers.heygen.com AND probed live — see `docs/vendors/heygen.md`,
which is the knowledge base this module implements:

    POST {base}/v3/video-agents            -> {data: {session_id, status, video_id|null, created_at}}
    GET  {base}/v3/video-agents/{sid}      -> {data: {status, progress, video_id, messages[]}}
    GET  {base}/v3/videos/{video_id}       -> {data: {status, video_url, failure_code, failure_message}}
    GET  {base}/v2/user/remaining_quota    -> {data: {details: {plan_credit}}}   (no v3 equivalent)

Three production lessons are encoded here, each of which cost us real renders:

1. **Credit is checked BEFORE submitting — in PLAN CREDITS, not the USD wallet.** A Video Agent
   render bills plan credits (26 for a ~38s clip, from the account's own usage history), so the
   wallet balance is irrelevant to whether a render can run. An earlier version of this gate read
   the wallet and would have refused every render on an account with 1,091 credits available.
2. **The SESSION is the authority, not the video.** A session can fail before it is ever assigned a
   `video_id`; polling only the video means waiting out the whole timeout on a run that is already
   dead.
3. **Failure detail lives in `failure_code`/`failure_message`, and often nowhere at all.** We used to
   read `error`/`message`, which HeyGen does not define — every failure logged an empty reason.
   When the documented fields are absent too, the session's `messages` are the only diagnostic.

    the agent can render any look you can *describe* — which is why HeyGen's own guide says to spend

    Two things go wrong with a Video Agent session, and neither is visible from the status word

    1. **`failed` is TRANSIENT, not terminal.** Observed live:
       `failed -> thinking -> generating (2 -> 31 -> 97) -> completed`, flapping back through
       `failed` mid-run. The old code raised on the first `failed` and abandoned a render that then
       completed vendor-side with nobody listening — that is why a video we had already been billed
       for went uncollected (2026-08-31) and why five nightly runs produced nothing.
    2. **A session can stall in a HEALTHY-looking state.** One sat in `thinking` at `progress: 0`
       for 25+ minutes. Nudging only on `failed`/`waiting_for_input` never touches it, so it just
       burns the deadline.

    So a nudge fires when the session is `failed`/`waiting_for_input`, OR when
    `(status, progress, video_id)` has not changed for `stall_s`. Any follow-up message resumes the
    agent — there is no `auto_proceed` — and both cases use the same `max_resumes` budget.

    ⚠️ A nudge reliably revives a **`failed`** session (three recovered live). It does **not** unstick
    a session hard-stalled in `thinking` at `progress: 0` — one was nudged and sat unmoved for
    195s+. The stall rule still earns its place there: it bounds the wait and reports
    "no progress for Ns" instead of an anonymous timeout, and the session is stopped on the way out
    so it stops holding one of the account's 10 concurrent job slots.

    The VIDEO's status is never terminal on its own either (it mirrors the session's flapping), so
