"""Earning autonomy (SEO-3) — the stage is derived from evidence, never configured.

The amended AI-SEO program grants the agent the right to merge its own posts only after a measured
track record. This is the measurement. Its central property: **`stage_for()` reads history; there is
no setter.** Nobody can grant autonomy by flipping a flag — the streak has to exist, which is what
makes S0 evidence-gathering rather than ceremony.

**How "zero human edits" is measured.** After a PR closes, count the commits on its branch that were
not the agent's. Zero means the post shipped exactly as proposed. This is deliberately mechanical
rather than a diff of prose: a human who touched the post at all left a commit, and a rewrite and a
typo fix both count as "not shipped as proposed" for promotion purposes — which is the conservative
reading, and the right one when the reward is unsupervised publishing.

⚠️ **Known limit, stated rather than hidden:** an edit made in a *separate* PR after the merge is not
counted. The streak measures "shipped as proposed", not "never subsequently touched". A reviewer who
merges and then quietly fixes it elsewhere would look like a clean record here.
