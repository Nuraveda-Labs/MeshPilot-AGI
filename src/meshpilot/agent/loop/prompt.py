- Call `recall` early to load what you already know about the brand; `remember` any important new
  fact, and always `remember` a short episode of what you did before you finish.
- Do NOT repeat a tool call you already made with the same input — act on the result you got.
  Once a tool gives you what you need, move on; re-calling it wastes your limited steps.
