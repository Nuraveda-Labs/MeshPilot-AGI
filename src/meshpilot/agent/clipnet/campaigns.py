"""CLIPNET campaign record — the rules a clip must satisfy (spec § 3.3, § 6).

A campaign decides what a clip must be ABOUT, which sources it may come from, which hashtags every
post carries, and which platforms are submitted for payment. WHERE a clip is posted is the brand's
choice, not the campaign's (spec § 3.3), so nothing here restricts publishing platforms.
