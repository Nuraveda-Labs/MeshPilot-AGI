"""The scheduled SEO loop: pick a topic → author → publish → later, settle (SEO-4).

SEO-1..3 built the pieces; this is what runs them unattended. Two capabilities, deliberately
separate because they happen at different times and have different failure modes:

- **`seo_publish`** authors one post and opens (or, once earned, merges) its PR.
- **`seo_settle`** asks GitHub what happened to PRs opened earlier and records it. Without it
  `human_edits` stays NULL forever, the streak never advances, and the ladder in `track.py` is
  decorative.

**This capability refuses far more often than it runs, and that is the design.** Publishing is a
code change in someone else's repo: it needs a git checkout, the site's npm toolchain, and a `gh`
that can open a PR. ⚠️ **The API's own runtime (FastAPI Cloud) has none of those** — no checkout, no
npm, no `gh` credential — so scheduling `seo_publish` there will refuse with `no_repo` rather than
fail halfway through a git operation. It runs where a checkout exists. Every precondition is checked
and named before anything is written, so a refusal says which one was missing.

Nothing here is brand-specific. The repo path, blog file, sitemap and author come from the brand's
own `<PREFIX>_SEO_*` env, and the site's real URL vocabulary is read from its **committed sitemap**
rather than guessed — the first live generation invented `/tools/drawdown-calculator` when the real
page is `/tools/firm-drawdown-calculator`, and an invented link is the same class of error as an
invented figure.
