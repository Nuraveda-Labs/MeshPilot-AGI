"""The agent loop (AGENT-LOOP) — recall → plan → act → observe → repeat → episode.

A native tool-use loop over Claude: each turn the model returns tool_use block(s) or finishes
with plain text; the loop runs each tool_use through the policy gate and returns tool_result
block(s), until the model stops calling tools (`stop_reason != "tool_use"`). Every run writes an
episode to memory. Publishing is denied by `policy.allow`, so the agent can plan/generate/
remember but cannot post.

`llm` and `execute` are injectable so the loop unit-tests with a scripted model + fake tools.
The injected `llm` has the `complete_tools` shape: async (messages, *, tools, system) ->
{content, stop_reason, usage}.
