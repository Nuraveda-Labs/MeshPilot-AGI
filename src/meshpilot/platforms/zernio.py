"""Zernio client — the OAuth-connected social surface (TARGET-3).

Zernio (`zernio.com/api/v1`) is a social-management platform holding an **OAuth-authorised**
connection to the brand's Reddit account — the same model as our Buffer publisher, and the reason
writing to Reddit needs no credential sharing and no Reddit Data API client of our own.

Used here for the piece that must happen *before* any participation: reading a room's **rules**.
Also exposes flairs, voting, posting and threaded replies, which TARGET-4 will use.

⚠️ Deliberately **not** used for discovery: its `/v1/reddit/search` returned nothing useful for our
queries, while redditapis.com returns live threads and communities with subscriber counts. Each
vendor is used for what it demonstrably does well.

Account ids are per-brand (`<PREFIX>_ZERNIO_REDDIT_ACCOUNT_ID`), so a second tenant points at its own
connected account with no code change.
