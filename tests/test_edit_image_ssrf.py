"""edit_image SSRF guard (#192) — the fetch must connect to the SAME address the guard validated.

Before the fix, `edit_image` called `assert_safe_media_url(url)` (which resolves DNS itself) and
then fetched the *original hostname URL* through a fresh httpx client — httpx re-resolves DNS at
request time, so a DNS-rebinding host could answer the guard's lookup with a public IP and the
fetch's lookup with a private/metadata IP (classic TOCTOU). The fix resolves the host ONCE via
`tools._web_url_resolve` (async, non-blocking) and pins the actual httpx connection to that exact
validated IP via `tools._pin_url`, mirroring the pattern already used by `web_fetch`.
