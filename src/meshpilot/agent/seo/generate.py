"""Authoring a post that satisfies the contract (SEO-2b).

The model writes; `contract.py` decides whether what it wrote is publishable. When it isn't, the
violations go back to the model as **specific, addressable instructions** — "3 H2 sections, need 4"
is a far better repair signal than "try again", and it is available for free because the contract is
structural rather than a matter of taste.

**Grounding is not negotiable.** Every firm-rule figure comes from the `firm_rule` table and is
handed to the model as fact; the model is told, explicitly, that it may not supply figures of its
own. The vertical is YMYL-adjacent and the program forbids "guaranteed pass" claims — a hallucinated
drawdown percentage published under the brand's name is the failure mode that matters most here, and
the same guard already protects the social copy.

Nothing in this module names a brand or an industry: topic, audience and grounded facts are all
passed in.

HARD RULES
- Every quantitative claim about a named firm MUST come from VERIFIED FACTS above, quoted exactly.
  If a figure you want is not there, write around it or omit the claim. Do NOT supply your own.
- Internal links MUST be chosen from SITE PAGES above, copied exactly. A path that looks plausible
  but does not exist is a broken link. Do NOT invent one.
- The StatCallout's sourceUrl MUST come from TRUSTED SOURCES above, copied exactly, unless you are
  certain of a specific page on one of those same domains. A URL that looks plausible but does not
  exist is worse than no citation, because it reads as one.
- No "guaranteed pass", no promised outcomes, no invented testimonials or funded numbers.
- The lede is at most 60 words and contains the direct answer. It is also the meta description.
- `tldr` is the direct answer in 2-3 sentences — the passage an AI search engine will quote.

REQUIRED STRUCTURE (all of it, or the post is rejected automatically)
- at least 4 blocks of type "h2"
- exactly one block of type "stat", whose sourceUrl is an EXTERNAL primary source (https://…)
- at least one "table" block, or a "list" block with ordered=true
- exactly one "antiPattern" block — what this post does NOT solve
- one "cite" block whose sources include at least 3 INTERNAL links (paths starting with "/"),
  spanning at least two different sections, e.g. /tools/… and /prop-firms/… and /brokers/…
- at least 5 FAQ pairs
