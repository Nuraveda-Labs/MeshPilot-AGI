"""Encrypted store for values the agent MINTS at runtime (SEO-11).

Config a human sets belongs in the environment. This is for the other kind: a credential the agent
creates for itself, which cannot be in the env because it does not exist until the agent makes it.
The first is a Discord webhook URL the agent provisions for its own alerts.

⚠️ Reads return the plaintext to the caller and NOTHING logs it. A webhook URL is a credential — the
holder can post as that channel.
