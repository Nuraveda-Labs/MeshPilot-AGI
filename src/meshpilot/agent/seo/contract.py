"""The editorial contract, as executable checks (SEO-1).

The operator's AI-SEO program defines what a publishable post must contain. Every clause of it is
structural, which is the whole reason autonomous publishing is even arguable here: "is this good
enough to ship" becomes a set of pass/fail checks rather than a matter of taste.

From `glitch-trade-app/src/data/blog.ts`'s own editorial contract:

    - lede ≤ 60 words and contains the direct answer
    - ≥ 1 StatCallout with a primary-source URL
    - ≥ 4 H2 sections
    - one comparison table OR ordered list per post
    - one anti-pattern callout ("what this is not solving")
    - FAQ section with ≥ 5 Q&A pairs
    - ≥ 3 internal links across clusters
    - every quantitative claim cites a primary source

Calibrated against the 11 posts already published to it. A representative one carries 5 H2, 1 stat,
1 list, 1 table, 1 antiPattern, 1 cite and 6 FAQ pairs — comfortably inside every threshold, which
is what a contract should look like when the humans writing to it are doing so naturally.

**What these checks are not.** They verify structure, not truth. A post can satisfy every clause and
still be wrong, which is why the conscience critic and firm-rule grounding sit alongside them rather
than being replaced by them. Passing this contract earns a post the right to be *considered* for
publication, not the right to be believed.
