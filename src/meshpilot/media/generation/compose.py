"""LLM composer for prompt-authored recipe phases (MEDIA-2).

Recipes whose phases carry `prompt_mode: "llm"` (or an `op: "llm"` step) don't
ship a fixed prompt — they ship an *instruction* the runner renders and hands to
a composer, which authors the concrete prompt the media model receives.

We route text generation through **muapi itself** (it's a unified gateway with
73+ text-to-text models — Gemini/Claude/GPT/DeepSeek). A muapi text model uses
the exact same submit→poll contract as the image/video models and returns the
generated text in `outputs[0]`, so the same `MuapiEngine` drives it — one key
(`MUAPI_API_KEY`) powers media *and* text, no separate LLM key.

The runner injects this via `compose=`; a fully-templated recipe never calls it.
