"""Reddit discovery client (TARGET-1) — find the conversations, and the rooms they happen in.

The agent's only sensing organ before this was CaptAPI, which covers Instagram and TikTok. For an
audience that lives on Reddit and X, that is the wrong organ: it can see trends in rooms this brand
has no reason to be in, and nothing at all in the rooms that matter.

Backed by **redditapis.com** (`REDDITAPIS_TOKEN`), verified live 2026-09-02. Reads only — public
posts and public community metadata. The same vendor offers comment/vote/DM writes behind an auth
route that takes a Reddit username and password; we deliberately do **not** use those. Writing to
Reddit goes through Zernio's OAuth connection instead, so no third party ever holds account
credentials (see `docs/plans/2026-09-02-targeting-and-distribution.md` §3).

⚠️ Reddit's own Data API is not an option here: its free tier is non-commercial only and names brand
monitoring as commercial, and the commercial tier starts around $12,000/month. This costs $0.002 per
read.

**Nothing in this module names a subreddit, an industry, or a brand.** Queries come from the caller
— ultimately from the brand's declared audience — which is what lets a second brand discover an
entirely different set of rooms with the same code.
