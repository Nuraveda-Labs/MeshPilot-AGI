"""Persistence for what discovery has SEEN (TARGET-1).

Discovery used to be ephemeral — a pull, a model read, and the observation died with the run. That
makes two useful questions unanswerable: *have we seen this thread before?* and *which rooms keep
producing things worth answering?* Both need memory, so observations land in `signal_item`.

Deliberately dumb: this records perception, it does not decide anything. Scoring and surface
selection are separate concerns reading from here — keeping them apart means re-scoring never
requires re-fetching, which is the difference between changing our mind for free and paying the
vendor again.

Never raises into the caller's path. A failure to remember an observation must not lose the
observation itself, which the caller already holds.
