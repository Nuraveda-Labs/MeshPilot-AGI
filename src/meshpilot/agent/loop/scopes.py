"""Per-run tool scoping (SCOPE) — bound the ReAct loop's toolset to the active job/pipeline.

A **scope** names a set of **capabilities**; a capability names a set of tools (an entry ending in
`*` is an `mcp__…` prefix match). The runner offers the model ONLY the tools the active scope allows,
so a capability is reachable only from the pipeline/job that asked for it — not by free-roaming
autonomy. Two independent layers: **scope = what's OFFERED**; the policy gate = **what's ALLOWED**
(kill-switches, caps). A tool runs only if it is in-scope AND policy-allowed. Default scope `chat` is
safe read+plan only (no external effects, no paid tools).
