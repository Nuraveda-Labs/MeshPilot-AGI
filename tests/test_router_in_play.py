"""The router must actually be in play — every agent LLM call routes through a tier.

Two ways a call silently bypassed it:

  * Omitting `tier=` entirely, so the call fell to the default model rather than a routed list.
  * Passing `model=`, which `_resolve_models` treats as an override and returns as a single-element
    list — so the call also forfeits the cross-provider failover the router exists to give. That is
    how the conscience critic ended up pinned to Haiku with no fallback: if that one model was
    rate-limited the review returned {} and every post was held.
