"""Pipelines (PIPELINE) — deliberate, scoped, scheduled agent runs.

A *pipeline* is the only place a capability turns on for real: a named run with a fixed SCOPE, a
goal, a cadence, and the kill-switches it requires. Capabilities are reachable from a pipeline, not
from a free-roaming agent — which is the whole point of scoping. Everything a pipeline relies on is
already enforced elsewhere: SCOPE bounds the offered *and* dispatched toolset (`scopes`), the policy
gate bounds effects (publish/discovery default-off) and spend (per-run caps), and a self-scheduled
follow-up is clamped to ⊆ the pipeline's scope (`cron.tool`). This module only *composes* those into
three concrete jobs — discovery, content, orm — as a declarative, versioned registry (mirrors
`scopes.py`). Nothing here runs autonomously: the manual trigger is operator-initiated, and seeded
schedules fire only when `agent_cron_enabled` is on.
